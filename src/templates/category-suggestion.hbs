I need to suggest a new category for a transaction that doesn't fit any existing categories.

Transaction details:
* Amount: {{amount}}
* Type: {{type}}
{{#if description}}
* Description: {{description}}
{{/if}}
{{#if payee}}
* Payee: {{payee}}
{{^}}
* Payee: {{importedPayee}}
{{/if}}

Existing categories by group:
{{#each categoryGroups}}
GROUP: {{name}} (ID: "{{id}}")
{{#each categories}}
* {{name}}
{{/each}}
{{/each}}

RESPOND WITH A JSON OBJECT that suggests a new category with these properties:
1. "name": A short, descriptive name for the new category
2. "groupName": The name of an existing OR NEW category group this should belong to
3. "groupIsNew": Boolean indicating if this group needs to be created

Example response:
{"name": "Membership fees", "groupName": "Subscriptions", "groupIsNew": true}

IMPORTANT: Create a specific category that:
- Is appropriate for the transaction details shown above
- Does NOT duplicate or closely resemble any existing category names
- Is specific rather than overly general
- Follows the naming patterns of other categories in the same group 

IMPORTANT: Your response MUST be:
- A SINGLE VALID JSON OBJECT
- No additional text or explanation
- No markdown formatting
- Properly escaped characters
- No trailing commas

Example of VALID response:
{"name": "Pet Supplies", "groupName": "Digital Assets", "groupIsNew": true}
